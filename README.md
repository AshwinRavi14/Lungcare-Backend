# LungCare – Backend Web Portal 🫁

LungCare is a healthcare-focused backend web application designed to manage lung-care patient data efficiently through a structured, scalable, and secure system.  
This project is currently **under active development** and focuses on real-world backend and system design practices.

---

## 🚧 Project Status
**Work in Progress**

Core backend functionality is implemented, with additional features and optimizations planned.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Build a scalable backend for healthcare data management
- Follow clean architecture and REST API best practices
- Gain hands-on experience with real-world backend challenges
- Apply system design concepts incrementally during development

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Language:** Java  
- **Framework:** Spring Boot  
- **Database:** H2 (File-based, local development)  
- **Build Tool:** Maven  
- **API Style:** RESTful APIs  

---

## ✅ Features Implemented
- Patient management APIs (CRUD operations)
- Database integration with JPA/Hibernate
- Layered architecture (Controller, Service, Repository)
- Centralized configuration using `application.properties`

---

## 🔜 Planned Features
- Search and filtering functionality
- Performance optimizations
- Security enhancements (authentication & authorization)
- UI integration
- Migration to production-grade database (MySQL/PostgreSQL)

## ⚙️ Running the Project Locally

### Prerequisites
- Java 17+
- Maven
- Git

### Steps
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/lungcare-backend.git
cd lungcare-backend
mvn spring-boot:run
The application will start on:

arduino
Copy code
http://localhost:8080
🧪 Database Notes
Uses H2 file-based database for local development

Database files are ignored by Git and generated locally

H2 console (if enabled): http://localhost:8080/h2-console

📘 Learning Focus
